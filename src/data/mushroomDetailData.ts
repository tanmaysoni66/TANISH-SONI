    overview: "White Button Mushroom is the absolute king of commercial mushroom farming in India, USA, and Europe. It is grown in high-tech, climate-controlled environmental setups utilizing PUF insulated panels and automated chiller/air handler units (AHUs). Cultivating button mushrooms requires strict compost formulation using pasteurized wheat straw or compost with nitrogen boosters. For optimal yield, adding a casing layer of pasteurized peat moss, coco peat, or well-rotted cow manure is critical. It offers highly stable year-round market demand from local wholesale markets, high-end hotels, supermarkets, and food processors.",
